# Ubuntu Development Machine

[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/Adron/dev-setup-ubuntu.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](https://waffle.io/Adron/dev-setup-ubuntu)

Setup & Installation

```shell-script
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adron/dev-setup-ubuntu/master/setup.sh | bash
```

Or if you'd like to trust but verify.

```shell-script
wget -O setup.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adron/dev-setup-ubuntu/master/setup.sh
```

Then set the file setup.sh with execute permissions and execute script.

This is the setup and installation script I've created for getting a basic Ubuntu development machine setup.
