Setup & Installation

```shell-script
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adron/dev-setup-ubuntu/master/setup.sh | bash
```

Or if you'd like to trust but verify.

```shell-script
wget -O setup.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adron/dev-setup-ubuntu/master/setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

This is the setup and installation script I've created for getting a basic Ubuntu development machine setup.
